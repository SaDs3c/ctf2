        <h3>Notice!!! Notice!!! Notice!!!</h3>
        For those who did the last tournament you 
        already know how this work, and for our new 
        members who do not, let's quickly explain how this work.
        Like we did the first Tournament, each webpage is a problem to be solve,
        including this webpage you are now.
    </p><br>
    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <p>
        There are multiple of webpages you are to bypass by finding the flag.
        each webpage contain an input field or input fields to submit your flag. if the flag you
        submit is correct that mean you solved the webpage and you
        will be move to the next webpage and so on.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        Just like the last Hacking Tournament, the first challenge start with a puzzle,
        and the first challenge always have two ways it can be solve
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li><span id="two"></span>Correct answer to the puzzle is the flag</li>
        <li><span id="two"></span>Username of any of the admin is the flag</li>
    </ol>
